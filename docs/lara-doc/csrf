CSRF Protection

	Laravel makes it easy to protect your application from cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

	Cross-site request forgeries are a type of malicious exploit whereby unauthorized commands are performed on behalf of an authenticated 
	user.

	Laravel automatically generates a CSRF "token" for each active user session managed by the application.

	This token is used to verify that the authenticated user is the one actually making the requests to the application.

	Anytime you define a HTML form in your application, you should include a hidden CSRF token field in the form so that the CSRF 	
	protection middleware can validate the request.

	You may use the  csrf_field helper to generate the token field:

		<form method="POST" action="/profile">
		    {{ csrf_field() }}
		    ...
		</form>
