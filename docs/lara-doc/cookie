Retrieving Cookies From Requests

	All cookies created by the Laravel framework are encrypted and signed with an authentication code,
	meaning they will be considered invalid if they have been changed by the client.

	To retrieve a cookie value from the request, use the cookie method on a Illuminate\Http\Request instance:

		$value = $request->cookie('name');

	Attaching Cookies To Responses

		You may attach a cookie to an outgoing Illuminate\Http\Response instance using the cookie method.
		You should pass the name, value, and number of minutes the cookie should be considered valid to this method:

		return response('Hello World')->cookie(
		    'name', 'value', $minutes
		);

	The cookie method also accepts a few more arguments which are used less frequently.
	Generally, these arguments have the same purpose and meaning as the arguments that would be given to PHP's native setcookie method:

		return response('Hello World')->cookie(
		    'name', 'value', $minutes, $path, $domain, $secure, $httpOnly
		);
