        REST stands for Representational State Transfer.

        It uses HTTP Protocol for data communication.

        In REST architecture, a REST Server simply provides access to resources and REST client accesses and presents the resources. 
        Here each resource is identified by URIs/ global IDs. 

        REST architecture treats every content as a resource. 

        These resources can be text files, html pages, images, videos or dynamic business data. 

        REST Server simply provides access to resources and REST client accesses and modifies the resources.

        REST uses various representations to represent a resource like text, JSON and XML.

        Following HTTP methods are commonly used in REST based architecture.

        <b>GET</b> Provides a read only access to a resource.

        <b>PUT</b> Used to create a new resource.

        <b>DELETE</b> Used to remove a resource.

        <b>POST</b> Used to update a existing resource or create a new resource.

        <b>OPTIONS</b> Used to get the supported operations on a resource.
