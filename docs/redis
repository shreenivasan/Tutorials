what is Redis?

    Redis is an advanced key-value data store and cache. 

    It has also been referred as a data structure server as such the keys not only contains strings, but also hashes, sets, lists, and sorted sets. 

3) Mention what is the difference between Memcached and Redis?

    Redis	                           
    
        Redis also does caching information but has got additional features like persistence and replication

        Redis does not support the functionality of LRU (least recently used) eviction of values

        In Redis you can set a time out on everything, when memory is full, it will look at three random keys and deletes the one which is closest to expiry

        Redis does not support CAS ( Check and Set). It is useful for maintaining cache consistency

        Redis has got stronger data structures; it can handle strings, binary safe strings, list of binary safe strings, sorted lists, etc.

        Redis had a maximum of 2GB key length

        Redis is single threaded

    what are the advantages of using Redis?

        Advantage of using Redis is

        It provides high speed
        It supports a server-side locking
        It has got lots of client lib

    List out the operation keys of Redis?

        TYPE key
        TTL key
        KEYS pattern
        EXPIRE key seconds
        EXPIREAT key timestamp
        EXISTS key
        DEL key
