Mysql Views

MySQL processes queries against the views in two ways

1) MySQL creates a temporary table based on the view definition statement and executes the incoming query on this temporary table

2) MySQL combines the incoming query with the query defined the view into one query and executes the combined query


Advantages

1) A database view allows you to simplify complex queries
2) A database view helps limit data access to specific users.
3) A database view provides extra security layer.

Disadvantages

1) Querying data from a database view can be slow
2) Tables dependency: you create a view based on underlying tables of the a database. 
   Whenever you change the structure of those tables that view associated with, you have to change the view as well.
3) Cannot use subqueries in the FROM clause of the SELECT statement defined the view before MySQL 5.7.7


MySQL viewâ€™s restrictions

You cannot create an index on a view.
Views and tables share the same namespace, therefore, a view and a table cannot have the same name.
Views can be updatable i.e. you can use the INSERT or UPDATE statement to insert or update rows of the base table through the updatable view
